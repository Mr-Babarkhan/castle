              The law specifically targets websites where owners do not know who contributed each item of content or that the website is a platform for uploading and publishing content.

              We have the policy to respond to any infringement notice and take appropriate action.

              Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) of 1998, the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website.

              </p>
              <p>
                The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the copyright infringement notification. If you are concerned about the privacy of your personal information, you may wish to hire an agent to report infringing material for you.

                If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification (&quot;Notification&quot;) using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must comply with the DMCA requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the removal or restriction of access.

                Not with standing anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.

                The process described in this Policy does not limit our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have to address suspected infringement.
